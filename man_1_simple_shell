.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "November 2025" "Holberton School" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B simple_shell
program is a minimalist UNIX command interpreter written in C.
It provides a basic prompt and allows the user to type and execute commands.
The shell was created as part of the Holberton School "The Gates of Shell" project.

.PP
The shell reads commands from standard input using the getline() function,
removes leading and trailing spaces or tabs, and interprets simple built-in commands.
If the entered command is not a built-in, the shell attempts to locate it
within the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

.PP
The shell runs in both
.B interactive
and
.B non-interactive
modes.

.TP
In interactive mode, it displays the prompt
.BR "#cisfun$ "
and waits for user input.
.TP
In non-interactive mode, it reads commands from standard input until EOF is reached.

.PP
When the end-of-file (Ctrl+D) is received in interactive mode,
the shell prints a newline and terminates gracefully.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The shell provides the following built-in commands:

.TP
.B exit
Terminate the shell with exit status 0.

.TP
.B env
Display the current environment variables, one per line.
